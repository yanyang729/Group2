How can I allow ajax calls to finish when accessing a page with cakePHP 3 http client or curl,"My issue is I need to render a chart using chartistjs then convert the svg to a canvas and write it to a png so I can include it in a pdf using wkhtmltopdf (cakePHP).If I load it in a browser it works fine but I need to do it behind the scenes, as the user can print without loading the view and I need to be able to bulk produce them.I tried using phantomjs but couldn't get that to work with the ajax call either and would rather not use it or any shell script if I don't have to. My thought is to use the Http Client class to load the view to render the graph, execute the js on the page which creates the canvas etc the posts the dataURL to another script and creates the png. As I said everything works but when I make the call with the http class in cakePHP the js doesn't finish and make the ajax post to create the image.this is my call but the ajax post doesn't completeI'm not sure I'm even approaching it in the correct way as getting the view done was easy and I may have started down the wrong path with blinders on as far as rendering the png which I wasn't expecting to have to do.

How to create regex for a arbitrary string of digits that must be equal and can optionally be separated by space,"I've spent about 3 hours trying to create a regex to validate a coordinate string that's homebrew (but based on MGRS). I've always had a rough time with regex and this one's starting to make me slam my head on my desk.I normally wouldn't ask for something this specific, but none of my friends who know regex were available to help, and my own research/attempts to learn at this point are taking too long.How would I go about creating a regex to validate the following (or is it even possible to do)? AZ AA 0123456789 0123456789 HG-20All whitespace is optionalThe first and second set of 2 characters is case insensitive, but must be a-z and be 2 characters for each section (first is grid zone identifier, second is subsection identifier).The easting and northing digit portion can be any arbitrary length, so long as the total number of digits between the 2 ""sections"" is even (e.g. ""1 1"" is valid, ""04563213245 54986187995"" is valid, ""5598 549"" is invalid). This is the part that I'm really just at a loss for.The 'H' is mandatory, but case insensitive (it's a delimiter for the ""height"" component of the coordinate string)The 'G' is optional (it indicates whether to use the locations ground height or not when converting to Unity coordinates)The last bit is a float, which can be negative. If a period is there, then a digit must follow.The entire height section is optional. If ""H"" is present, at a minimum a digit must come after (same rules as the last 2 bullet points basically).I'm using C# and System.Text.RegularExpressions for the regex engine.The part that's really getting to me is the main digit component. I'm not sure if this is possible (especially considering that the easting and northing can be seperated by whitespace).So far I've been able to come up with:But it doesn't actually validate whether the length of the coordinates sans whitespace is even or not and isn't able to tell if the entire height section is optional or not (it technically makes the H required...no clue how to subsection it...).Ultimately, since I break the string apart in code I could validate it with actual code (if the digit sub string is not even throw InvalidArgument or ArgumentOutOfRange exception since this logic happens in a constructor for a Location class). That seems like it would be bad juju if the validation can be done in regex though.Examples:AZ AA 012345 012345 HG-20 (valid)AZAA 012345 012345 HG-20 (valid)AZAA012345012345HG-20 (valid)AZ AA 012345 012345 (valid)AZ AA 012345 01234 (invalid, easting and northing are different lengths)AZ AA 012345 012345 HG (invalid, must have digits if 'H' is present)AZ AA 012345 012345 H (invalid, must have digits if ""H"" is present)Thanks!In case anyone is curious about how my code currently looks:","[c#, regex, validation]"

Is this function call really ambiguous?,"I'm learning about multiple inheritance and the diamond problem, and when I make a function call from the most derived class Visual Studio tells me that the call is ambiguous:I understand if I had overridden the base class function in the B and C classes then the call would be ambiguous, but isn't ""aFunction()"" the same in B and C?Also, making B and C inherit from A virtually makes the error go away. But my understanding of the keyword ""virtual"" when inheriting, ie., (Derived : virtual Base), is that it prevents a ""more derived class"" further down the chain from inheriting multiple copies of a Base up the chain. In inheritance multiple copies of member variables can be inherited, but only one copy of a function with the same name. So for example I could have 5 Derived classes each deriving from Base, and then a MostDerivedClass inheriting from all the 5 Derived classes, in the MostDerivedClass I would have 5 copies of the Base class ""member variables"", but only one copy of a function with the same name. So in other words the ""virtual"" keyword for inheritance should prevent multiple Base ""member variable"" copies. I don't understand why it would clear up an ambiguous function call in this case.EDIT: Thank you, it's slowly sinking in. It was impossible for me to imagine ""two copies"" of A in D, because A is empty (no size). But then I remembered that C++ never creates empty classes, on my setup for example an empty class has size 1. Then I was able to imagine ""two copies"" of A in D, and it's starting to make sense now.","[c++, inheritance, polymorphism, virtual]"

I open the rails console and run the following:then...This returns 1 as is expectedThis returns 1 as is expectedThis returns 2 as is expected.However, when I run in the console...y.up_vote_count / y.total_vote_countThis returns 0 when it should return .50. I've been reading about floats/integers/decimals, etc and I do see this in the schema on the model i'm working from:Is this my problem?...and if so what do I have to do to allow myself to do a simple formula like the one above in rails console that will return the correct decimal rounded to 2 digits (i.e, .50 in this case above). I don't know if I want to run any migrations to change data types because this is a gem (&amp; as a beginner I tend to stay away from customizing code from any gems I'm using). Is there another way? something small i'm missing hopefully?UPDATE:I'm learning decimals are slower than floats also, so is there any way to accomplish this with continuing to use t.float ""value"", default: 0.0thanks for any help.","[ruby-on-rails, ruby-on-rails-4, floating-point, decimal, rails-console]"

How do I make these models work with Entity Framework?,"A long time ago I started working on a simple project to learn a bit more about ASP.NET.

Detect SKPhysicsBody collision after SKPhysicsBody has been applied,"I have simple gameplay that functions like this:My goal is to detect when the ball hits the white part (game over scene would load) or when the ball hits the gray part (game continues)Because the shapes shrink and have a lot of stuff going on, I figured it would be a lot more efficient to just create the SKPhysicsBody when I need it, and then remove it after the collision checks happen. So when I click the screen this happens: (after 5*0.0325 seconds--how long it takes the circle to shrink--has passed, it will add the physicsbody to both the gray and white part so I can detect which the ball is touching)Which works. The SKPhysicsBody are applied to both the gray and white part perfectly without any loss in framerate and follow the rotation. The problem is... how do I detect which is the ball touching? Since they did not formally collide, it will not call the collision at all (which makes sense since they did not really collideThis is the basic logic, and it works perfectly until I want to check the results:someone touches the screencircles shrinkright after they shrink it will create an SKPhysicsBody for both the gray and white part based on its textureProblem is here... how do I detect which the ball is touching?

"When linking to ID, element appears underneath header","I'm new to web development, mostly just trying to teach myself how with internet tutorials and such. I'm a complete newbie, so this might be a dumb question, but I've searched google up and down, and have yet to find an answer.Basically my problem is, I've created a web page with position: fixed; header at the top of the page. I've adjusted the margins of the page so that everything seems to look great. The page displays exactly as I intended it to.However, I've come across a small flaw which I find myself incapable of fixing: I have a few links on the page that link to specific headings elsewhere on the same page. (For example, I have an element such as &lt;section id=""section_3""&gt;...&lt;/section&gt;, and elsewhere on the same page I'm using &lt;a href=""#section_3""&gt;...&lt;/a&gt;. It works and leads me to the appropriate header, but unfortunately the top of &lt;section&gt; element I linked to (mostly just the section heading) is being covered up by the fixed header at the top of the page, so I have to scroll up a little to read the section header. I've tried linking to an &lt;h1&gt; rather than a &lt;section&gt; element, thinking it might be incompatibility with html5 or some such, but I have the same problem that way too. I'd like to have it so that the section header is the first visible element under the header when I follow these ID links. How can I do this? I would assume this is a common enough situation that there would be a simple fix to it, but I can't seem to find anything on the subject. (I have no issues using html5 or css3. Currently this is just a personal project, and by the time I'm making anything public I expect it will be far enough down the road that there won't be any issue using those. For the time being, it only needs to work on my browser.)Thanks in advance for anyone who can help!","[html, css, html5, css3]"
Compliance to a schema in neo4j,"I am thinking of using a graph DB to store IFC data. Ideally, the DB should provide a way to define all the rule types defined in the IFC schema. However, I don't think there are any such databases because some of the rule types in IFC are very complex and requires querying the DB. Others are simple, like uniqueness of GUID, existence of mandatory attributes, or data validation. Neo4j seem to have a few constraint enforcing methods: Neo4j helps enforce data integrity with the use of constraints. Constraints can be applied to either nodes or relationships. Unique node property constraints can be created, as well as node and relationship property existence constraints.Are there other methods that can ensure compliance of entered data with a predefined schema?Or are there other graph DBs that are more suitable for this job?","[neo4j, graph-databases, step, ifc]"
Google apps script - Importing sheet values from another sheet,"I'm pulling my hair out a little trying to write a conditional Google apps script for Google sheets. The sheet has 5 tabs.

Whoever is controlling the form needs to be able to assign a specific row of data to a specific administrator, which each have their own tab set up. They do this by selecting, from a drop down, which admin they want to assign the row to.So, if row 2 is assigned to ""Miranda,"" Certain data would get moved over to the ""Miranda"" tab.

How to find and truncate a list to the nearest power of 2 (in the most pythonic way),"I have a list called data, and I want to truncate it so that it's length is a power of 2.

You can decrease the FFT compute time by using this trick, with little effect on the results. An FFT works by breaking the data up into odd and even sets and the more times it can do this, the faster it computes. Hence, the more divisible the length is by 2, the more splits can be made, and the shorter the compute time is. In contrast, lists lengths that are prime numbers are the slowest. I don't intend to spark a discussion on 'zero padding' vs. 'truncating' data for an FFT, but rather focus on the most pythonic way to find the nearest power of 2 for a given number.","[python, numpy, scipy, fft]"

Using context without any static reference,"I am trying to access application resources, (string resources to be specific) from a Singleton class. Being Singleton, this class cannot hold any reference to Context objects (to prevent memory leak). While I was looking for other implementations on the net, I came across this two implementation:Create a static context in Application class and use it across the app.Pass context as a parameter to the method that requires it.I don't want to use the fist one as it also uses a static reference to Context object. I understand that it's ok to have it statically in the Application class of android, but still it looks like a hack.The second implementation is useless since i don't have any instance of context which I can pass to the someOtherMethod of the singleton. So I came up with following implementation where I make my Singleton abstract to override its context requiring methods (for ex. getString(int resId) in the code below) when I initialize the singleton instance.I am curious to know if this can lead to any memory leaks now? Where am I confused with this approach: --> The reference to context in the Overridden getString is final. I am not sure if that can cause a memory leak or not.","[android, design-patterns, memory-leaks, singleton]"

How can I undo only one given auto-format operation in VS Code?,"In Visual Studio, Auto-formatting will occur, e.g., after completing the syntax of a C# function definition via close-parenthesis or after typing a semicolon. Sometimes, this is great! Other times, the auto-formatting destroys my alignment intention by applying its own, different opinion on the matter. Consider this example:// Before finishing the method definition, no auto-formatting:public OverloadedConstructor(int[] things, int andSuch) : this(things, andSuch, new HelperObject(andSuch) /* missing a ')' here */ { }// After finishing the method definition by adding the missing ')'public OverloadedConstructor(int[] things, int andSuch) : this(things, andSuch, new HelperObject(andSuch)) { }Regardless of which alignment you may prefer, Visual Studio never really destroys my intention because the auto-format operation is inserted into the undo stack. If I ever wish to undo its auto-format operation, I merely press Ctrl+Z and my original formatting is recovered. I would press Ctrl+Z again if I wanted then to undo the typed close-parenthesis.However, in Visual Studio Code, the auto-format operation is combined with the parenthesis input--upon pressing Undo, VSCode removes the auto-format as well as the close-parenthesis I just typed, the re-typing of which again causes the erroneous auto-format, which puts me in a never-ending loop of frustration!I have tried searching for a setting that will reproduce Visual Studio's behavior of having a separate undo history for auto-formatting operations, to no avail. Is there a setting that will preserve this ""undo auto-formatting separately"" workflow, or is there a different workflow I should learn for VSCode to individually decide per auto-format whether to keep its effects?","[visual-studio, workflow, vscode]"

Swift SKSpriteNode: Complex Sprite Textures?,"This is a question regarding best-practice for implementation. For an example, I will reference a simple game called Pixel Claw. Suppose I had an SKSpriteNode akin to the claw from Pixel Claw, in that what the SKSpriteNode might be ''holding'' is variable (but finite in possibilities, e.g. four different objects). What the node SKSpriteNode is holding has no agency of itself. Thus my question is: is it better to use different textures such as a claw, a claw holding object a, a claw holding object b, etc or have two SKSpriteNodes and position the SKSpriteNode with the claw texture to be next to the SKSpriteNode with an object texture?I am not making a claw game, it was just the first example that popped to my head where both could be plausible solutions.

how can i eliminate whitespace between navbar and main background div?,"hoping you can help. It's been a long time since I've coded without frameworks and such so I am purposely using vanilla html and css as a refresher.I have begun building a quick website prototype, and I cannot for the life of me figure out why there is whitespace underneath the navbar element and my background section, despite creating css rules specifically for a full viewport background.

I could set the color to match with my background section, but somehow I feel that might cause other problems later..or at least it feels like cheating. Is there another possible solution? Most importantly, WHY is this happening given the css rules I have set?

Swift SKSpriteNode: Chaining Sprites by Image Feature,"ContextFor the purpose of a MWE we will be using the following image of a stick figure:with the goal of having a chain of these sprites move, hand-in-hand, across the screen:It is worthwhile to note that the stick figure image itself is wider than the arm-span of this stick figure. The background is, however, transparent. Depending on the application, one may make a class that either inherits from SKSpriteNode or encapsulates it, e.g. a class called Person, to store additional information, where there may be an array var people = [Person]().Questions1.) Suppose you had two instances of the aforementioned Person class with each sprite taking a stick figure image. How could one position them - programmatically - such that the sprites are touching ''hand in hand'' although the image has a transparent background? Of course one could spend some time fiddling about to get find a spacing parameter to ensure this is achieved, but that parameter would always have to be, via trial-and-error, re-calculated if the sprites were re-scaled.2.) Given a chain of these sprites, hand in hand, how could one animate them to move across the screen at the same velocity? If one calculates the spacing parameter alluded to in 1.) then an SKAction could be given to each Person such that their end position is offset (but total distance traveled is the same), where the TimeInterval is maintained the same. Is there a way to tell all the sprites to move to the left until off the screen at a rate of $x$ pixels per second?","[swift, skspritenode]"

"In an ASP.NET web form, how to determine what causes a Page_Load()","I want to implement a finite state machine (FSM) inside a typical ASP.NET web form. I would like the FSM ""engine"" to be automatically invoked each time a Page_Load() event happens - which is easy enough - but I also want the engine to receive information about which event caused the Page_Load() to occur. The difficulty is that in an ASP.NET web form, a user-controlled event, such as a button click, can cause the page to reload, but the event handler for the button click itself does not get invoked until after the Page_Load() event fires. As far as I can tell, the Page_Load() handler itself does not contain any information about what user event caused the page to reload. I would prefer not to have to explicitly invoke the FSM engine from within each event-handler method. Is there any way to accomplish this? -- to have Page_Load(), or some other stage in the page life-cycle, ""know"" what particular user action caused the page to reload?","[asp.net, pageload]"

Ensuring session strict mode in custom SessionHandlerInterface implementation,"IntroSince PHP 5.5.2 there is a runtime configuration option (session.use_strict_mode) that is meant to prevent session fixation by malicious clients. When this option is enabled and the native session handler is used (files), PHP will not accept any incoming session ID that did not previously exist in the session storage area, like so:(with session.use_strict_mode disabled, the response would have not included a Set-Cookie header and a sess_madeupkey file would have been created in the sessions directory)ProblemI am in the process of implementing a custom session handler and I'd pretty much like it to adhere to the strict mode, however the interface makes it difficult.When session_start() is called, MyHandler::read($session_id) is invoked down the line, but $session_id can be either the value fetched from the session cookie or a new session ID. The handler needs to know the difference, because in the former case an error must be raised if the session ID cannot be found. Moreover, according to spec read($session_id) must return either the session contents or an empty string (for new sessions), but there seems to be no way to raise an error up the chain.So to sum up, the questions I need to answer in order to match the native behavior are:From the context of read($session_id), how can I tell the difference between a newly minted session ID or a session ID that came from the HTTP request?Given a session ID that came from the HTTP request and supposing that it was not found in the storage area, how would I signal an error to the PHP engine so that it would call read($session_id) again with a new session ID?","[php, session]"
Java List Horrible Adding Performance,"I'm adding millions of entries of a custom object to a List. This turns out to be very slow and the graphical user interface keeps freezing randomly as well (not responding on Windows) even though the adding operation is wrapped in a SwingWorker so it should not affect the EDT. Furthermore, the CPU utilization goes up to around 70% - 90%.I'm initializing the list as follows:Then I'm repeatedly callingto add elements.I'm aware that the ArrayList internally uses an array which is resized when it is full and all elements are copied over. However, using a LinkedList has shown to be slower than the ArrayList though and no other List implementation exists.According to this answer, adding to an ArrayList has a performance of O(1). The question arises why my approach of collecting all results is still so awful performance-wise. SearchResult is a simple data object encapsulating fields and initializing it is cheap since only fields are set.As comparison, adding to the list is noticeably slower than sending the same amount of data over a network socket. This doesn't make any sense since local operations should always be way faster than network related operations.1 million elements finishes in about 0.2 seconds but 67 million won't even finish in a reasonable amount of time. It should finish like a few seconds at maximum.What is the big issue here?","[java, performance, arraylist, add]"

CKFetchNotificationChangesOperation: why are READ notifications all nil?,"I'm using the following code to fetch notifications.

According to the WWDC 2014 video 231 (Advanced Cloudkit), your other devices still need access to notifications that have been marked as read. They give an example citing an app that highlights large transactions on all devices, and once any device marks the notification as read, any other devices should see that ""read"" notification and disable the highlight also.OK, fair enough.

Matplotlib is hanging when using python3 (OSX Sierra),"Matplotlib hangs now that I've upgraded to Sierra. The behavior is different depending on how I run it.

Using JQuery on a page to look at various page and get .size(),"I need your help folks!I would like to know the best practice of how to retrieve a variable from a page other than the one that's loaded.For example, let us assume this is a blog website.

I've read other people using the window object to create variables while keeping global scope clean. This is over my head and none of the examples I've read make it seem like it is being used over several pages.

Using external resx files (not embedded) at runtime in C#,"I have an application where users can define custom elements by adding their own xaml files. These files are loaded by the application on startup. The idea is to be able to extend the application without having to recompile it. These elements will be shown on screen to the user, and the xaml files may contain resource keys which are not included in the resx files of the application itself. So I have a requirement to have separate resx files which the user can edit, that will also be loaded at runtime.I've looked at the ResourceManager class, and I know that it can be set to access resources from various other assemblies. But from what I gather the resources must be part of an assembly, which is precisely what I don't want. What I want is to have a bunch of files like these: %ProgramData%\MyApplication\Resources\strings.resx  %ProgramData%\MyApplication\Resources\strings.de-DE.resx  %ProgramData%\MyApplication\Resources\strings.zh-CN.resxand I want my application to be able to load these files and access the strings in them. This article https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/gg418542(v=vs.110).aspx shows two approaches using ResXResourceReader and ResXResourceSet. However, it appears that these classes take a path to a specific file (or a stream), and therefore won't be able to pick the correct file according to current culture and the naming convention. I know I can code this myself, and that's what I'll do if I don't find a better solution. But ideally I'd want something that handles this for me.

Scheduling methods to run in ASP.NET,"Explanation:I am developing a simple car business system and I have to implement the following feature:A very special car model is delivered to a shop. There are a lot of people on waiting list exactly for this model.When the car arrives the first client receives the right to buy it, he / she has 24 hours to use this opportunity.I have a special state in the DB that determines if the user is: on waiting list (I have the exact position, as well) or can use opportunity to buy the car. Whenever the car arrives, I run a method that changes the state of the first client on waiting list. And here comes the problem:Problem:The client can use his opportunity, during the 24 hours period. But I have to check at the end, if he/she has bought the car. For this reason, I have to schedule a method to run in 24 hours.Possible solution:I am thinking about two things. First is using a job scheduler like Hangfire. The problem is that since I do not have any other jobs in my app, I do not want to include a whole package for such a small thing. Second is using making the checking method asynchronous and making the thread sleep for 24 hours before proceeding (I do not feel comfortable in working with threads and this is just an idea). I got the idea from this article. Keep in mind that more than one car can arrive in more than one shop. Does it mean that I should use many threads and how it is going to affect the performance of the system?Question:Which of the two solutions is better?Is there another possibility that you can suggest in this particular case?

What is the advantage (if any) of MPI + threads parallelization vs. MPI-only?,"Given a cluster of several nodes, each of which hosts multiple-core processor, is there any advantage of using MPI between nodes and OpenMP/pthreads within nodes over using pure all-MPI? If I understand correctly, if I run an MPI-program on a single node and indicate the number of processes equal to the number of cores, then I will have an honest parallel MPI-job of several processes running on separate cores.

Python: why does this local list variable in class method retain its value?,"I searched around and found this article which gives me a lead on why this is happening -- it seems I've just come across a more complex and subtle case of it.

But obviously it doesn't.The puzzle gets more complex if I modify the doNotCare = myList.pop() line, instead using a slice to update the list:...which somehow defeats that unexpected retained value, yielding the output:So I suppose the first question would be, is this in fact just a more complex and subtle case of the default-parameter behavior described in the reference? If it is, then why doesn't the behavior apply to myInt -- or even to myList, when I manipulate it with slicing instead of pop?","[python-2.7, list, class, methods]"

The way it works is you pass x, y, and z coordinates into the Noise function and it is supposed to return a value between 0 and 1 (at least that is how I understand it should work).

Spring Integration listen on queue without poller,"I want to implement the HTTP endpoint using Spring Integration, which listen to the http requests, sends the request data as messages to the channel and another endpoint should listen messages on this channel and process them.Sounds simple. But what I want to achieve is:Messages should be processed in order.Messages should be processed asap (without delay after http request, if the queue is already empty).The http request should be responded as soon as message is received, not after it is processed, so the sender will know only that message is received for processing.I don't want to use external queues, like RabbitMQ.So I need a QueueChannel for this. But if I understand correctly, the only way to receive messages from the queue is the poller. So the point 2 will not be satisfied. There will be small delay after message received and before poller sees it.So the question is: is there any simple way to achieve this in Spring Integration which I don't see?Of course I can implement it myself. For example creating SmartLifeCycle component, which listen on DirectChannel and just put the messages into java.util.concurrent.BlockingQueue, and also starts a dedicated thread which will wait on this queue and send the message into another DirectChannel for processing. So there will be no delay because thread will be unblocked as soon as BlockingQueue is not empty.This all sounds like a ""pattern"" - some queue between two direct channels based on dedicated thread.Maybe there is a simplier way, already implemented in Spring Integration, which I just don't see because of absense of expirience in this area?","[java, spring, spring-integration]"

Serving PHP with Variables Provided by NodeJS + Express,"I'm attempting to create a NodeJS + Express (currently + Handlebars) app that serves web pages using data from FirebaseIO. However, I have a personal preference for programming in PHP, and, in many cases, it's more optimal for my use case, mostly because of its inline style. FirebaseIO, though, does not support PHP and it's REST API only does database requests (and not other things such as storage or Auth).What I am interested in doing is have NodeJS + Express receive requests, then pass them on, along with variables Node has retrieved from Firebase, to PHP. PHP would process the request and the variables given it by Node and return a web page which would be sent back to the client via Node.I'm looking for something extremely stable though (I noticed a couple libraries on GitHub that promise to do this, but they all seemed to be in beta or experimental phases).If it's not possible to do what I've described, is there any other way to have PHP generate the web pages using variables attained by NodeJS? I'm guessing one way is to add Node on another port of my server and query it using CURL, but wouldn't this have implications for the speed of requests?Please elaborate and suggest as many paths forward as you can think of.","[javascript, php, node.js, express]"

"When calling tf.Session.run, is it important for performance to minimize what is fetched?","In Tensorflow, the fetches argument to tf.Session.run serves two purposes: it ensures that certain ops are run, and it returns values to python. My question is how concerned I need to be to avoid returning values I don't actually need. For instance, suppose that op a depends on op b so that if a is evaluated b will be too. Could it be faster to dothan to dobecause the latter would copy the output of b from the GPU to the CPU only for it to be discarded? If only a fraction of the information in a is needed on the python side, is it generally a good practice to make a tensor depending on a that only has exactly what is needed and to fetch that instead of a? Or am I misunderstanding something about how these GPU-CPU transfers work? I think it is possible to profile how much time is spent in transfers like these (e.g., see graphs here: https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/4526), but I don't understand how to do it yet, and I would like to know if I am at least conceptualizing things correctly regardless of whether my particular application happens to be bottlenecked here.",[tensorflow]

If you clicked the background link though, you know that with compiled code bracket (mallocBytes n) free was resulting in “double free or corruption” while allocaBytes works fine (the problem is not visible when in GHCi at all, everything works fine in both cases).By now I've spent two days in painful debugging and I'm pretty confident that bracket (mallocBytes n) free was unstable somehow and the rest of the code is reliable.

Rails 5 SQL Injection,"I've read about this for some time now on various SO threads, guides, etc... but all the answers are conflicting and contradictory.It seems there's many similar methods, and a lot of the answers say to use a different one.sanitizesanitize_conditionssanitize_sqlsanitize_sql_arraysanitize_sql_for_assignmentsanitize_sql_for_conditionssanitize_sql_hashsanitize_sql_hash_for_assignmentsanitize_sql_hash_for_conditionssanitize_sql_likeI'm trying to write a 'raw query' adapter that lets me run raw Postgres queries, but allowing me to insert my own parameters that come from dangerous user input.I can't use AR in these few instances because I'm doing complex lat/long calculations, aggregate functions, complex subqueries, etc.So far I have tried 2 approaches:Method 1For this method, I don't know if sanitize is the best option of the above, or if it will work in 100% of cases... (I'm using Postgres only)Trivial usage example (normally it wouldn't be this simple of course, or I would just use AR):RawQuery.new.exec('SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = $1', params[:name])Furthermore it seems that sanitize delegates to quote. But according to this SO post it says simply wrapping things with single quotes isn't secure... so I have no idea.Method 2I'm not sure if this is just as secure, but it seems to use an actual PG prepared function (which I assume is 100% secure). The only problem is rails doesn't print it out to the console, nor include the SQL execution time (which breaks my profiling tools).Used the same way:RawQuery.new.prepare('SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = $1', params[:name])Is one method more secure over another? Are both 100% secure?My apps always extend far outside of what Rails is capable of SQL-wise and I need a good lib I can include on all my projects which I know is completely safe.","[ruby-on-rails, ruby, postgresql, activerecord, ruby-on-rails-5]"

Java program runs slower when code that is never executed is commented out,"I observed some strange behaviour in one of my Java programs. I have tried to strip the code down as much as possible while still being able to replicate the behaviour. Code in full below.I have two functions, functionA() and functionB() that call each other recursively. Both functions take a recursionDepth parameter that controls the termination of the recursion. functionA() calls functionB() a maximum of once with recursionDepth unchanged. functionB() calls functionA() 16 times with recursionDepth - 1. The recursion terminates when functionA() is called with a recursionDepth of 0.functionB() has a code block with a number of System.out.println() calls. This block is never entered into, as entry is controlled by a boolean recursionFlag variable that is set to true and never changed during program execution. However, commenting out even one of the println() calls causes the program to run slower. On my machine, execution time is &lt;0.2s with all the println() calls present, and >2s when one of the calls is commented out.What could be causing this behaviour? My only guess is that there is some naive compiler optimisation that is being triggered by a parameter related to the length of the code block (or the number of function calls etc.). Any further insight into this will be much appreciated!Edit: I'm using JDK 1.8.","[java, recursion, compiler-optimization]"

Why (and how!?) is Android changing my references?,"I have quite a bit of experience in Java, and up until I noticed this bizarre behaviour in my first android app I thought any references I create will always point to the same Object unless some code with access to the reference changes it.I had an activity with to two fragments under it inside a ViewPager. In the activity I maintain references to the two fragments (private fields) to interact with them. On orientation change my fragments are stopped (and apparently destroyed as well) so I am creating them again from the activity because they have complex state that I don't wanna bother ""parceling"" or ""serializing"" into a bundle... This may not be best-practice, but hat's not my question though. It's more about how the Android JVM and libraries manage to automatically change the activity's private reference to the fragment (which I'm setting in the onCreate method) to point to an automatically constructed fragment using the default constructor. I understand that android can destroy fragments and construct new ones later and invoke onSavedInstanceState or whatever to allow the developer to recover their fragment's state; but how does it also find and change the existing reference in the activity to point to the newly constructed fragment.This seems to be a JVM-level feature (more than just simple reflection), that allows Android to figure out all existing references to the fragment (or is it? what am I missing?) in order to modify them when a fragment is re-created. Whatever the case, is this and Android-specific JVM feature? Does a similar thing exist in other Java implementations such as Oracle Java or OpenJDK?Please keep your answer about the weird automatic reference juggling part, and not about how I'm managing the activity/fragment life-cycles (I'm aware I could do better, and I'd love to read your suggestions, but keep those in the comments or the second part of your answer). I've done a lot of debugging and that's what I observed: the fragment reference was indeed changing, and I managed to fix it by manually resetting the reference to the reference I explicitly set in the onCreate method - a seemingly redundant operation.","[java, android, jvm, dalvik]"
What is the best way to have user specific numbering in Django?,"I'm making a web site for a friend for a small business, and for each user, I want them to be able to access their orders by number which starts from 1 for each user, but in the backend this should be a global numbering. So for each user, their first order will be at /orders/1/ and so on. Is there a consensus on how this should be achieved in general? Way I see it, I can do this 2 ways:Store the number in another column in the orders table. I'd prefer not to do this because I'm not entirely sure how to handle deletions without going through and updating all the records of the user. If someone knows the edge cases I need to handle, I might go with this.ORFor every queryset I make when getting the orders page for each user I handle the numbering, benefit of this is that it will always give the correct numbering, especially if I just do it in the template. Right now this seems easier, but I have a feeling this would give rise to problems in the future. Main problem I see is I'm not sure how to make it link to the correct url without the primary key being in that url.","[django, user]"

How to normalize composite attribute?,"I need to normalize a relation so that it is in the 1st normal form. I know how to normalize multi-valued attributes, it is just composite attributes that are giving me issues. For example, one of the composite attributes is 'Employee-Address', and as expected, it contains sub-attributes like 'House-Number', 'Street-Name' etc.How do I normalize this? These composite attributes are not multivalued/complex i.e a single employee may only have 1 address. I also believe the 'employee-id' attribute can be used to identify all of sub-attributes of the address. Is it as simple as breaking up the composite attribute and storing each sub-attribute as its own attribute in the relation? This way all the sub-attributes would become simple, single and stored values?Before anyone complains; this question is related to a college assignment and I've looked through the entirety of the recommended textbook(and the internet) for the answer, which I have not found.

How to add an element and sort an array whiling iterating?,"Could you one help please to resolve this problem?I have an ArrayList of nodes that is sorted by ascending order based on ratio of distance.

Notice that the total demand of all nodes are less than or equal to the capacity. During the process of assignment, if there is a node cannot assigned to the depot, then it is required to recalculate its ratio at the same time starting from the second nearest depot to the third nearest depot.

Firebase: How to count likes in a twitter like app?,"firefeed.io as a twitter clone suggests: Every user has their own feed, which is a combined list of all sparks posted by them, and by all the users that they are following. No other sparks must appear in this feed.Which basically means that if user A posts a tweet (= spark), it will be written in all the feeds of user A's followers. With this logic every user needs to observe only a single node.But how could one handle the number of likes or retweets in this approach? Let's assume user B likes user A's tweet. I can only think of two ways:User B updates the likes count in all the feeds of the users that are followed by A with transactions.There is an additional node tweetLikes/$tweetId where the number of likes is changed with transactions. But this means that an observer is needed for every tweet retrieved from one's personal feed. This would destroy the abovementioned benefit of observing one single node.Which one is prefferable? Are there better ways to accomplish this goal?","[firebase, firebase-database]"

why do we have multiple layers and multiple nodes per layer in a neural network?,"I just started to learn about neural networks and so far my knowledge of machine learning is simply linear and logistic regression. from my understanding of the latter algorithms, is that given multiples of inputs the job of the learning algorithm is to come up with appropriate weights for each input so that eventually I have a polynomial that either describes the data which is the case of linear regression or separates it as in the case of logistic regression. if I was to represent the same mechanism in neural network, according to my understanding, it would look something like this,multiple nodes at the input layer and a single node in the output layer. where I can back propagate the error proportionally to each input. so that also eventually I arrive to a polynomial X1W1 + X2W2+....XnWn that describes the data. to me having multiple nodes per layer, aside from the input layer, seems to make the learning process parallel, so that I can arrive to the result faster. it's almost like running multiple learning algorithms each with different starting points to see which one converges faster. and as for the multiple layers I'm at a lose of what mechanism and advantage does it have on the learning outcome.

F# Record vs Class,"I used to think of a Record as a container for (immutable) data, until I came across some enlightening reading.Given that functions can be seen as values in F#, record fields can hold function values as well.

Which plays better with functional concepts, such as pattern matching, type inference, higher order functions, generic equality...Analyzing further, the Record could be seen as an interface implemented by the makeRecord() constructor. Applying (sort of) separation of concerns, where the logic in the makeRecord function can be changed without risk of breaking the contract, i.e. record fields.This separation becomes apparent when replacing the makeRecord function with a module that matches the type’s name (ref Christmas Tree Record).Q’s: Should records be looked upon as simple containers for data or does state encapsulation make sense?

Best way to determine a new site user - Django,"I want a way of checking if someone has filled out their profile information (new user) with django. If they havn't I want to show a modal that won't go away until all information has been filled out. No matter what page they go to, it should show this modal until filled out. Should I do the check with javascript(ajax) to a route that would make the check and return a json request with the answer? If the json object says they are new, I would append the modal to the screen dynamically.Update: I use django's authentication system. Here is an example of logging in. The check would be similar but I would be using model I made in another app that extends Django's base user class. I call it user_profile. I would probably check to see if the user's first name is set. If it isn't I would wanna perform the check.","[javascript, ajax, django, user]"

Also most memory settings in Sandbox (MapReduce memory, Yarn memory, Yarn container sizes) allow much less memory than corresponding settings in a real cluster. Still it is sufficient for Pig in Sandbox but not sufficient in a real cluster.Another note - Hive queries doing the similar job also work good (in both environements), they do not complain about memory.Apparently there is some setting somewhere (within Environment 2), which makes Pig to request too much memory?

It is causing a dependencies clash :Also, simply putting applications.properties in src/main/resources as detailed in the tutorial doesn't work.It does work if I manually set the following (this is what I use with Spring Security) :But if I remove the previous code, it definitely doesn't find applications.properties :Parameter 0 of constructor in org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.orm.jpa.HibernateJpaAutoConfiguration required a bean of type 'javax.sql.DataSource' that could not be found. - Bean method 'dataSource' not loaded because @ConditionalOnProperty (spring.datasource.jndi-name) did not find property 'jndi-name' - Bean method 'dataSource' not loaded because @ConditionalOnBean (types: org.springframework.boot.jta.XADataSourceWrapper; SearchStrategy: all) did not find any beansWould anyone know how to solve this problem, or have a lead ?

touch events on canvas not always properly firing on ipad / iOS10,"I have expierenced strange touch behaviour with a web app on my ipad air with iOS 10, where sometimes events on objects draws on canvas are not firing. To narrow down the problem, I have created a simple test case, where I draw 25 rectancles on a canvas, each having an event handler attached.Now when I tap on the rectancles, some won't fire the event, so the code in the event handler is never executed. There are always at least 1 or 2 rectangles that don't behave normally (mostly more), and which ones are affected changes with each reload. The handler on the underlying div always fires a touch event. When I had a more complex setup, sometimes the event would be registered on an underlying layer. But again, only for a few of the rectangles. I'm using Konva.js as a library (before was using kineticjs, same behaviour). This is my code : producing this simple example: The rectancle top left is 0,0, bottom right is 5,5. On touch each rectangle should log it's identifier, but some just don't want to fire the touchend event (and they keep not firing until I reload the page, then other rectangles are randomly selected for malfunction...).

Using getter and setter on an object property that has his own properties,"I'm fairly new to getters and setters and am looking for a way to listen for changes in an object to store the data immediately, without calling a Save() function everytime a value gets changed. This is how I do it right now:Now I would like to optimize this code so everytime a property in myObject.Data is changed, myObject.Save() is executed. The problem I'm experiencing is that it seems only possible to define a getter for a property that has just one value, but not for a property that is an object itself. This obviously doesn't work since myObj.Data is not an object and doesn't have the same properties as myObj._Data.Thanks in advance for any help.","[javascript, getter-setter]"
Powershell Command to Copy Latest Version of Multiple Files,"I am trying to do a restore of my OneNote notebooks but they restore process isn't ideal. It stores copies of the notes and appends a date to them, and a number if there is more than one for each day. I want to grab the latest file (note) and move it to a folder and then I can restore them instead of using their process.I have tried using gci | select last -1 which only gets me the latest file in the entire directory.

What exactly the purpose of React Virtual DOM,"While going through react I came up with the following doubts:DOM operations are very expensiveBut eventually react also does the DOM manipulation. We cannot generate a view with Virtual DOM.Collapsing the entire DOM and building it affects the user experience.I never did that, Mostly what I do is changing the required child node(Instead of collapsing entire parent) or appending HTML code generated by JS.Examples: As a user scrolls down we append posts to parent element, even reactalso have to do it in same way. No one collapse entire dom for that. When a user comment on a post we append a div(comment element(HTML code)) to that particular post comment list. I think no one collapse entire post(dom) for that 3) ""diffing"" algorithm to check changes:Why we need a algorithm to check changes. Example: If I have a 100 posts, whenever a user clicks on edit button of a particular post, i do it as followsI am telling the DOM to change particular element, then how does diffing help?Am I thinking in a wrong way? If so, please then correct me.","[reactjs, dom]"

Why does VC++ 2010 often use ebx as a &quot;zero register&quot;?,"Yesterday I was looking at some 32 bit code generated by VC++ 2010 (most probably; don't know about the specific options, sorry) and I was intrigued by a curious recurring detail: in many functions, it zeroed out ebx in the prologue, and it always used it like a ""zero register"" (think $zero on MIPS). In particular, it often:used it to zero out memory; this is not unusual, as the encoding for a mov mem,imm is 1 to 4 bytes bigger than mov mem,reg (the full immediate value size has to be encoded even for 0), but usually (gcc) the necessary register is zeroed out ""on demand"", and kept for more useful purposes otherwise;used it for compares against zero - as in cmp reg,ebx. This is what stroke me as really unusual, as it should be exactly the same as test reg,reg, but adds a dependency to an extra register. Now, keep in mind that this happened in non-leaf functions, with ebx being often pushed (by the callee) on and off the stack, so I would not trust this dependency to be always completely free. Also, it also used test reg,reg in the exact same fashion (test/cmp => jg).Most importantly, registers on ""classic"" x86 are a scarce resource, if you start having to spill registers you waste a lot of time for no good reason; why waste one through all the function just to keep a zero in it? (still, thinking about it, I don't remember seeing much register spillage in functions that used this ""zero-register"" pattern).So: what am I missing? Is it a compiler blooper or some incredibly smart optimization that was particularly interesting in 2010?Here's an excerpt:Notice: an earlier version of this question said that it used mov reg,ebx instead of xor ebx,ebx; this was just me not remembering stuff correctly. Sorry if anybody put too much thought trying to understand that.","[visual-c++, assembly, x86, visual-c++-2010]"

Elm divide subscription?,"I'm playing with Elm and WebRTC, so I made a listen port which gets some messages from js:Now I would like to be able to divide the messages to different parts of my app. For instance, the chat uses the ""chat"" channel, while the game logic uses ""game"".Is it possible to create a listenTo String subscription that filters out the messages with the correct channel (only returning the data)? Or perhaps a different way of doing it?Update:What I currently have, is something like this:In my main.elm I have an update that looks like this. It can receive messages (from rtc) itself, and send messages for chat to it. (I would later add a ""ForGame"" then too)Then I have subscriptions that combines all my subscriptions:In Chat.elm I have a similar structure, with an update that handles it's messages. The subscription of the chat listens to all messages from WebRTC, but filters only the ones with channel chat:(Ignore is a Msg for chat, which just does nothing case msg of Ignore -&gt; (model, Cmd.none). decodeMessage uses a decoder to decode a message decodeMessage : String -&gt; Result String Message.)I'm quite happy with this, because this way all logic for chat is in Chat.elm. So main.elm doesn't need to know what channels chat is using. Chat just follows the standard structure (Msg, update, view, subscriptions) and main forwards everything.The only thing that's still not great, is that in Chat.elm I have the forChatMessages function. Used like: subscriptions model = WebRTC.listen forChatMessages. I would like to make this more reuseable, so it would become something like:It would then be reusable by the game:Update 2:I managed to generalize the forChatMessages function into:So I think I found the solution myself.

Center one element along with multiple siblings,"I have a div with some number of spans in it, that may or may not be of equal width. I know I can use text-align: center to make all the content within a div be centered. However, I want to pick a particular span, and designate that as the true center, rather than the center being the midpoint of the sequence of spans.One idea I had to simulate this effect was: I'd have my desired middle element with two containers to its left and right; the left one would be right-justified, and vice-versa. These containers would hold the other content in the div. If I could get these two containers to fill up the remaining space in equal amounts, this would have the effect of centering the middle element while keeping the left and right content aligned with the center. Basically, this would require the two containers' width to be set to exactly half the remaining space in the div. (I don't want to change the size of the middle div.)

Aren't the Terminal-symbols that A..G can produce also meant to be taken into consideration? They could possibly appear as input-symbols too, can't they?So...Which of the following statements is true and whyTo First(X) you...1 only add the first Nonterminal that does not have epsilon in it's First-Set and that follows a sequence of Nonterminals which do have epsilon in their First-Set2 add the first Nonterminal that does not have epsilon in it's First-Set and follows a sequence of Nonterminals which have epsilon in their First-Set AND additionally the First-Set of each Nonterminal from that sequence.... without the epsilon, except when the sequence of Nonterminals that can derive epsilon goes straight through to the rightmost Nonterminal from the right-hand-side of the production and there is no Terminal in-between or after that sequence.Happy new year",[parsing]
class giving an error and not running?,So i have just learned how to use classes and i made this class but i can't make it to run i useto make the classthen on loop i use spacecraft1.motion() to update / move. From all of this i get error: and is it possible to create like 40 of these spaceships at same time without defining everyone of them likeHere is my class if it helps something. And this class and the main gamefile are in seperate files but in same folders.Full code here(Google Drive),"[python-3.x, pygame]"
Android start 160.000 AsnycTasks,"For my master thesis I need to analyse iris recognition data. Therefore I have about 400 templates created. Each of this templates has to be compared to each other template, resulting in ~160.000 matching results.Those results need to be uploaded to my Azure Easy Table. I really don't know where to start as the ThreadPoolExecutor cannot handle more than 128 Threads in parallel.What is the correct approach to do something like this? Time is not really an issue.This is my current approach:This approach works for some time,. but then the system starts to kill all threads and uploading is cancelled.","[android, azure, android-asynctask]"
What&#39;s the point of have multiple (same resolution) iOS simulators?,"I've been developing iOS apps for some time now and I'm aware that the iOS simulators run code faster than their hardware counterparts - i.e. actual devices. I read the following on Apple's Testing and Debugging in Simulator documentation site. Because the simulator is an app running on a Mac, it has access to the computer’s resources, including the CPU, memory, and network connection. All of these resources are likely to be faster than those found on a mobile device. As a result, the simulator is not an accurate test of an app’s performance, memory usage, and networking speed.I understand that completely. I also understand that it's important to have multiple simulators to test different size-classes/resolutions.What I don't understand, however, is why Apple include so many simulators for devices with the same resolution. See the following picture showing iPhone 6, 6s and 7 - all of which have the same screen size and resolution.Given that the simulator runs at 'full speed' (regardless of which devices its actually simulating), what's the point of having all those simulators (each taking up a few GB of storage)?Thanks in advance,Loic","[ios, iphone, xcode, ios-simulator]"

Turing Diffusion in JavaFX,I was trying to translate a Turing Diffusion model from JavaScript to JavaFX as seen here: CODEVIDEO... but my code is not behaving properly. I believe is a combination of bad logic and the way I am updating the UI. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Code compiles and runs. Update: Fixed one error in the update equations.,"[user-interface, math, javafx]"
